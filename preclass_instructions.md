## Setup Instructions

### Intro

Hello, and welcome to Introduction to Programming with Ruby through Girl Develop It RDU! We're so excited you've decided to take the leap into programming, and can't wait to get started with you.

Before class starts, I'd love for you to take some time getting your computer set up with Ruby and other various dependencies. This will allow us to hit the ground running when we're together.

Set up can be tricky, so please reach out to us if you have any issues at all before class starts. A few ways to get in touch:
* Post a message in the Meetup group
* Better yet, join us on Slack! [Go here](ADD INVITE LINK HERE) to join our slack organization. Hop in the "intro-to-ruby" channel and I'll be there to help with any setup issues!

### Instructions

We'll be using Railsbridge's Installfest instructions to get set up. Railsbridge is an awesome organization that we're friends with and you should be, too!

[Follow these installation instructions](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/).Just work through the instructions for your operating system. Stop after the "Configure Git" step.This process should take about an hour.

Again, please reach out with any questions! We are here to help! And, if you get stuck on any steps, don't worry. We'll help you during class. :smiley_cat:
