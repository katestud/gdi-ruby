# Intro to Ruby

The slides for this course can be viewed [here](http://katestud.github.io/gdi-ruby)

This is an Intro to Ruby course. Original material was created by Cheri Allen and Heather Moore, with thanks to Chris Pine and Sandi Metz for inspirational books. This material was modified by Kate Studwell for the GDI RDU Chapter. 

The course was originally designed to be taught in 5 two-hour sections. The GDI RDU chapter course is taught in 4 two-hour sessions, with some pre-class setup steps.

## Course description

Ready to start programming? Want to learn one language that you can use to build web apps and iPhone apps, do system administration, and security? Then you're ready to learn Ruby.

Ruby is an open source language that powers applications and products like Hulu, LivingSocial, Groupon, and Github. There is a thriving, friendly community of users, and the job market for developers is strong.

Through this four course series, you'll get a throrough introduction to programming fundamentals with Ruby. We'll use the Interactive RuBy shell; write command line programs that use loops, conditionals, methods, and classes; and learn the basics of object oriented programming. We'll also learn the basics of git so you can share your code with the world. We'll mix lecture and practice, and help guide you through the coursework.

We'll share some set up steps before the first class, but if you're not able to set things up beforehand, there will be time at the beginning of the first class to complete step and do any troubleshooting necessary.

### Prerequisites:

You should have:

An interest in programming and be comfortable using a computer.


### Tech requirements:

 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A text editor. We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).


### Topics covered:

 - Class 1 - Intro to programming in Ruby

    What is programming? What is Ruby? We'll give you some context for the class, have a brief lecture on working with the command line, and then dive right into writing code. Using the Interactive Ruby Shell, we'll begin experimenting with variables, methods, and data types. We'll end the class by writing a little interactive command line program.

 - Class 2 - Structured programming (loops and conditions), working with collections data types

    We'll create small programs in the text editor that use conditionals and loops for control flow. Then, we'll explore Ruby's collections data types, and see some of the ways we can work with them.

 - Class 3 - Object Oriented Programming, part I

    We'll discuss the basic concepts of object oriented programming. We'll write our own methods, and explore some of the predefined methods that are available in Ruby for certain classes of object.

 - Class 4 - Object Oriented Programming, part II

    We will expand our knowledge of OOP by discussing classes and inheritance. We will tie together everything we've learned with a relatively complex, totally fun final project.
